## üßê What?
"The Truth of Supply Chain Collaboration" is a short name for the project titled "**Factors influencing the collaboration in supply chain of apparel enterprises in Ho Chi Minh City**.

## ü§∑ Why?  
The tension between üá∫üá∏ the US and üá®üá≥ China starting from 2019 has provided new opportunities to sign more processing contracts for myriad enterprises in Vietnam, especially for electronics companies and apparel manufacturers, but technically, they are not in full preparation to take advantage of it.

The biggest problem, also a huge paradox, was revealed in 2016 by the General Secretary of VINATEX, Truong Van Cam, who confirmed that while each year the apparel enterprises had to import tons of textile for production, our annual textile export still remained at USD 1 billion on average, which indicated and proved the very loose connection and collaboration among those entities. Fortunately, eliminating this paradox by enhancing the collaboration in supply chain, especially between the suppliers and the apparel manufacturers, is considered the key and the most comprehensive solution to all the aforementioned current obstacles. 

## ‚öíÔ∏è How?  
Data collections of occupancy, indoor air data, and weather data were conducted in 3 weeks with the support of sensors. Following that, descriptive analytics, statistical and machine learning models were implemented. Ensemble models as well as single ML models would be applied.

    <em>Layout of the indoor area</em>

## üß± Structure?
This repository contains 4 folders:
- **data**, including:
    + raw (external data, and primary data in their rawest formats)
    + temp (temporary data sets which only function to support data processing decisions)
    + processed (filtered selected data based on study scope, study goals and data processing trials)
    + final (the data set ready for modelling)
- **src**, including:
    + final-data-processing-and-modelling (main data processing and modelling codes)
- **deliverables**, including:
    + project-summary (the final defense in which I summarize the whole project)  
    > **Note**

- **media** (media files)
  
## ‚úåÔ∏è Result?

    <em>Average occupancy at any point of time per 30 minutes</em>
</p>

In summary, the project has succeeded in detecting and estimating the number of occupants with high accuracy. Regarding occupancy detection, most of the models return an accuracy around 80% to 90%, which is acceptable for a large room. As for the occupancy classification, the best model reach the accuracy of 70% for every 2-minute observation, even better than other models with more indoor and outdoor variables as well as contextual information.

- **Academic contributions**: The study provides a big primary dataset of occupancy, indoor air, and outdoor atmosphere. It applies insights from theories and studies on occupancy detection to a modern indoor space.  
- **Practical contributions**: The evidence of obtaining occupancy detection and classification model has been provided. Also, the study points out key issues that might help the process of developing this application.

On a more personal note, the project has received positive feedback from examiners and supervisors. Here are some of the remarks:
 > "**Fantastic work and very independent study** with detailed analysis on multiple aspects of indoor quality." 

 > "**Brilliant and precise, very professional** presentation, relevant results and smart research framework development."

## ü™Å Future?
More information about ventilation detection is required for getting the exact number in the long term.
